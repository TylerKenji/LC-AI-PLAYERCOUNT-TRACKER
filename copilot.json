    "This project notifies the user via Discord when the game 'Limbus Company' reaches a new all-time high for online player count.",
    "Use the Steam Web API endpoints GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers and GetSchemaForGame to fetch player data.",
    "Persist the previous all-time high player count in a local file (e.g., JSON or text).",
    "On each run, compare the current player count to the stored all-time high. If the current count is higher, update the file and send a Discord notification.",
    "Send notifications to Discord using a webhook.",
    "Write clean, modular JavaScript code. Use async/await for API calls.",
    "Include error handling for API requests and file operations.",
    "Document functions with concise comments.",
    "The project is implemented in the 'src' directory, with separate modules for API access, notification, and configuration.",
    "Use environment variables or a config file for sensitive data such as API keys and Discord webhook URLs.",
    "The main entry point is 'src/index.js'."
